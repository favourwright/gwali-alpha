            <div class="title">THE JOURNEY</div>
            <div class="content">
            	<p>We began as a closed Whatsapp group run by a team of students working tirelessly to provide legible class notes, assignments solutions and tutorials for fellow students in need of academic help. We did all these at no cost at all to students.</p>
                
                <p class="padding_top_medium">We learned that our Whatsapp group quickly became the most populous group chat in our faculty reaching 150+ participants in less than 24hours. Now at full capacity, the need for our services became very glaring. Hence, the launching of this online platform to make the service available to every student and make the user experience more personal to enable you study at your best and as you like.</p>

            <div class="content">
            	<p>One goal is to be a platform where students can always share and find resources that meet their specific needs. We also intend to develop a community of students (AKA “Gwalians” or “G-boys/G-girls”) who are willing to contribute to the database of resources available to students on gwalinotes.com</p>
